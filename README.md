# Telegram AI Agent with Spring AI

This project implements an AI-powered Telegram bot using **Spring Boot** and **Spring AI**, integrated with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. The bot leverages MCP to provide AI agents with contextual information and tools, enabling intelligent and context-aware responses to user interactions.

## Features

- **AI-powered responses** using Spring AI framework
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** integration for enhanced context awareness
- **Spring Boot** application for easy deployment and configuration
- **Telegram Bot API** integration for seamless messaging
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Easy to configure and maintain

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables AI agents to access tools, data sources, and contextual information in a structured way, making interactions more intelligent and context-aware.
